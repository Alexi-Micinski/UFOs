# UFOs

## Overview

Updated a webpage and created a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, filters were added for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To use the search fields, simply type the desired filter into the filter box of interest. For example, if you want to look at the UFO sightings for Willow, Alaska, type 'willow' into the city filter box and 'ak' into the state filter box. Use the format of the placeholders to conduct a successful search.

## Summary

One drawback of the filter boxes is that you can only filter by one thing at a time. Two suggestions for further improvement include:

  1. Allow for multiple fields to be entered at the same time.
  2. Allow for multiple entries in one field to be entered at the same time. 

This would allow you to filter by two countries or two states at a time. Or specify all fields.
