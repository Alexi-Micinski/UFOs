# UFOs

## Overview

Updated a webpage and created a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, filters were added for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To use the search fields, simply type the desired filter into the filter box of interest. For example, if you want to look at the UFO sightings for Willow, Alaska, type willow into the city filter box and ak into the state filter box. Use the format of the placeholders to conduct a successful search.
